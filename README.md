Description

La villa del seis is a multiplatform point-and-click graphical psychological terror adventure in PHP and DHTML that uses mouse and keyboard optionally.
Also, you can play it like a text adventure (interactive fiction) on a text browser or without JavaScript.
The game uses Yasmina's Quest motor but altered and improved.
You can use the motor/engine/parser to create your own adventure if you know PHP and JavaScript.
This cross-platform and cross-browser game was tested under PC (Windows, BeOS, Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Syllable, SkyOS, etc), MAC (Mac OS 7.1, Mac OS X), Amiga, console (Nintendo DS, PSP, Dreamcast, XBOX), etc.
