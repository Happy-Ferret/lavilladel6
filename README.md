## Description

Open source adventure game written in PHP, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This game was made in late 2006 and uses the engine of Yasmina's Quest that I made before, modified and improved. It was made together with Yasminan Llaveria del Castillo and some of the photos used were taken by Esteban Villegas Gallego.

Official languages are Spanish and Catalan.

It has become quite famous on the Internet, with thousands and thousands of downloads and online players. It was even mentioned in at least one well-known Spanish magazine called "Año/Cero" in an article titled "La ruta de los pueblos condenados" written by José Manuel Serrano Cueto and published in January 2007.

Since this has the Yasmina's Quest engine but improved, some people has chosen the code of this game to create their adventure instead of using the Yasmina's Quest code. As well as Yasmina's Quest, the game can be played either as a point-and-click adventure or as a text adventure and it can run in any kind of web browser. JavaScript and CSS are useful but not really necessary. Images are not necessary either, allowing the game to be played in a text-based web browser as Lynx or Links.

This game has been tested under BeOS, Linux, NetBSD, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, Windows, Mac OS X, QNX, BlackBerry Tablet OS, Android, iOS and others. In its homepage you can see some screenshots with the game running on many different platforms such as Nintendo DS, Sony PSP, Sega Dreamcast and Pocket PC.

It can be played offline on Windows XP with SP2 (Service Pack 2) and newer (including Windows 10) by using the [php-webkit](https://github.com/baconbrad/php-webkit) version provided, available to download in "*(the la_villa_del_seis_php-webkit_win32.zip)*" or the "*(la_villa_del_seis_php-webkit_win32.7z)*" file.
